# WLAN and Mobile Security Plan ‚Äì Alliah Company

This project presents a wireless and mobile security strategy for a fictional company, Alliah, which relies heavily on remote and mobile workflows. It analyzes WLAN and mobile device vulnerabilities and proposes policy and technical mitigation strategies based on NIST guidelines and industry standards.

## üîß Tools & Frameworks Referenced
- NIST SP 800-153: Guidelines for Securing WLANs
- NIST SP 1800-22: BYOD and Mobile Device Security
- CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- CIS Controls
- BitLocker, MDM/EMM tools, WIDS/WIPS

## üîç Key Focus Areas
- Misconfigured access points
- Rogue AP detection and mitigation
- Device loss, theft, and encryption
- Mobile app control and user training
- BYOD policy design and segmentation
- Data protection under GDPR and CCPA

## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Strategies Proposed
- Use of MDM for app control, encryption, and remote wipes
- Formal BYOD policy enforcing registration, MFA, and patching
- Implementation of WPA2/WPA3 and WIDS/WIPS tools
- Continuous monitoring with SIEM for APs and mobile device logs

## üìÑ Deliverables
- PDF-based security assessment and mitigation plan
- Recommendations mapped to NIST and legal frameworks
- Support for Alliah's BYOD adoption strategy
