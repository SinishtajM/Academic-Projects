# Digital Forensic Investigation ‚Äì Insider Threat Case Study

This project simulates a full-spectrum digital forensic investigation in response to an insider threat incident within a fictional corporate environment.

## üîß Tools Used
- FTK Imager (disk imaging and hash verification)
- Autopsy (forensic analysis of images)
- EnCase (timeline, USB artifact, and metadata analysis)
- Wireshark & NetworkMiner (network traffic inspection)
- SHA-256 hashing and write blockers for integrity assurance

## üß™ Investigation Objectives
- Acquire and preserve digital evidence using proper forensic procedures
- Create forensically sound disk images and maintain chain of custody
- Analyze browser history, file metadata, USB device usage, and network traffic
- Identify policy violations and trace unauthorized access patterns
- Produce a legally sound forensic report aligned with:
  - NIST SP 800-86 (Guide to Integrating Forensic Techniques into Incident Response)
  - ISO/IEC 27037 (Guidelines for Evidence Collection and Preservation)

## üìÑ Deliverables
- PDF report of investigation findings
- Timeline of evidence events
- Integrity hash logs and chain of custody documentation
