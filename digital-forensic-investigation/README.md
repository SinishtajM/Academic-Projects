# Digital Forensic Investigation ‚Äì Insider Threat Case Study

This project simulates a full-spectrum digital forensic investigation in response to an insider threat incident within a fictional corporate environment. It is divided into two parts: an initial forensic report and a detailed analysis of recovered artifacts.

## üîß Tools Used
- FTK Imager (disk imaging and hash verification)
- Autopsy (forensic analysis of disk images and artifacts)
- EnCase (timeline analysis and USB/device tracking)
- Wireshark & NetworkMiner (packet capture and traffic review)
- SHA-256 hashing and write blockers for integrity assurance

## üß™ Investigation Objectives
- Acquire and preserve digital evidence using forensically sound procedures
- Create verified forensic images and document chain of custody
- Analyze user behavior, deleted files, metadata, USB activity, and browser history
- Detect signs of intellectual property theft and data exfiltration
- Produce a legal-grade forensic report aligned with:
  - NIST SP 800-86 (Integrating Forensic Techniques into Incident Response)
  - ISO/IEC 27037 (Guidelines for Evidence Collection and Preservation)

## üìÑ Deliverables
- **01-digital-forensic-investigation.pdf**  
  Executive-level summary of the insider threat investigation, including procedures, tools used, and key findings.

- **02-artifacts-findings.pdf**  
  Detailed analysis of the digital artifacts recovered during the forensic imaging process, including evidence of malicious user activity and suspicious files.
